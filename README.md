# Page-Replaccement-algorithm-simulator
📄 Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator
An interactive web-based simulator for visualizing and comparing various page replacement algorithms used in memory management. Designed for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to understand how different algorithms handle page faults.


🚀 Features
🧠 Supported Algorithms
FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

LRU (Least Recently Used)

Optimal


🎛️ Controls & Configuration
Custom Page Sequence Input
Input your own sequence of page references (e.g., 8,8,4,3,2,4,3,4,3,3)

Frame Count (1-10)
Define the number of page frames to simulate.

Speed Selection
Choose simulation speed: Slow, Normal, Fast.

Random Sequence Generator
Generate a random page reference string.

Step-by-Step Execution
Visualize the algorithm step-by-step using the Step button.

Playback Controls

Start: Run full simulation

Pause / Reset: Control the execution

Sound Effects
Toggle sound for visual feedback on page faults or hits.
